# game-template-for-the-atari-2600
A template code for an Atari 2600 game

Heavily inspired by Gustavo Pezzi (gustavopezzi here on GitHub) of Pikuma's design of an Atari VCS game,
this template contains the minimal code for starting an Atari 2600 game using 6502 Assembly and following the NTSC standard.

This template is meant to be used with the DASM assembler alongside it's helper headers.
